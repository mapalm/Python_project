# Python_project

This project is a part of the course "Python programming for life science researchers" at the University of Gothenburg.

This script is for pulling out data from a large dataset (in a .csv file). The script will ask for input about which type of information and based on what parameters to do this.

## Usage
To use the script, simply run the following command:  
> ``` python ./Python_project_MartinPalm.py ```  

**Remember to put your data .csv file in the same directory as the script.**  

If you are using Python 2 use the script 'Python_project_MartinPalm_python2.py'.  
If you are using Python 3 use the script 'Python_project_MartinPalm.py'.

## Data types
The data types that are currently available are:
* All information (all)
* Accession numbers (accessions)
* Resistance patterns (resistances)
* Positions in microtitre plates (positions)
